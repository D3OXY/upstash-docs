title: "Flow Control"
---

FlowControl enables you to limit the number of messages sent to your endpoint via delaying the delivery. 
There are two limits that you can set with the FlowControl feature: [RatePerSecond](#ratepersecond-limit) and [Parallelism](#parallelism-limit).
And if needed both parameters can be [combined](#ratepersecond-and-parallelism-together).

For the `FlowControl`, you need to choose a key first. This key is used to count the number of calls made to your endpoint.

<Warning>
The rate/parallelism limits are not applied per `url`, they are applied per `Flow-Control-Key`. 
</Warning>
There are not limits to number of keys you can use.

## RatePerSecond Limit

The rate limit is the number of calls that can be made to your endpoint per second. 
QStash will delay the delivery of the messages if the rate limit is exceeded. 
In case of burst calls to QStash, a delivery can be delayed as long as necessary to guarantee the rate limit.

<Warning>This parameter is deprecated. Use `rate` and `period` instead.</Warning>

## Rate and Period

-   The `rate` parameter defines the number of requests that can be activated within the specified period for the same flow control key.
-   The `period` parameter specifies the time interval for the rate limit, which can be set as a number (in seconds) or a duration string (e.g., '10s' for 10 seconds, '5m' for 5 minutes, '1h' for 1 hour, or '2d' for 2 days). It defaults to '1s' if not specified.

You can set the rate limit 10 calls per second as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

await client.publishJSON({
    url: "https://example.com",
    body: { hello: "world" },
    flowControl: { key: "USER_GIVEN_KEY", rate: 10, period: 1 }, // period in seconds
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
            -H "Content-type: application/json" \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Key:USER_GIVEN_KEY"  \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Value:Rate=10,Period=1s" \
           'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://example.com' \ 
            -d '{"message":"Hello, World!"}'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parallelism Limit

The parallelism limit is the number of calls that can be active at the same time.
Active means that the call is made to your endpoint and the response is not received yet. 

You can set the parallelism limit to 10 calls active at the same time as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

await client.publishJSON({
    url: "https://example.com",
    body: { hello: "world" },
    flowControl: { key: "USER_GIVEN_KEY", parallelism: 10 },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
            -H "Content-type: application/json" \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Key:USER_GIVEN_KEY"  \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Value:Parallelism=10" \
           'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://example.com' \ 
            -d '{"message":"Hello, World!"}'
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also use the Rest API to get information how many messages waiting for parallelism limit.
See the [API documentation](/qstash/api/flow-control/get) for more details.

### Rate and Parallelism Together

Both parameters can be combined. For example, with a rate of 10 per second and parallelism of 20, if each request takes a minute to complete, QStash will trigger 10 calls in the first second and another 10 in the next. Since none of them will have finished, the system will wait until one completes before triggering another.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

await client.publishJSON({
    url: "https://example.com",
    body: { hello: "world" },
    flowControl: { key: "USER_GIVEN_KEY", rate: 20, period: 1, parallelism: 10 },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer XXX' \
            -H "Content-type: application/json" \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Key:USER_GIVEN_KEY"  \
            -H "Upstash-Flow-Control-Value:Rate=20,Period=1s,Parallelism=10" \
           'https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/https://example.com' \ 
            -d '{"message":"Hello, World!"}'
```
